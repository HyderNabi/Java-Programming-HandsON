Adapter Classes simplify the creation of event handlers in certain situations. An Adapter class provides an empty implementation of all the methods in an event Listener Interface. Adapter classes are useful when you want to receive and process only some of the events that are handled by a particular event Listener Interface. You can define a new class to act as an event listener by extending one of the adapter classes and implementing only those events in which you are interested.
